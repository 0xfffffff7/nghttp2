spdylay 1.0.0
=============

Release Note
------------

This release adds several enhancements to the spdyct and shrpx and
strict checks for name/value pairs.  It fixes the bug that server can
not push the stream against server initiated stream ID. The internal
priority management mechanism is updated so that outbound DATA frames
with variety of SPDY priority can interleave more frequently and don't
let the low priority streams starve. The development is very stable
now, so we'll make this release 1.0.0.

Changes
-------

* Adjust priority of outbound DATA frames so that it does not starve
  others

  This change makes frames with variety of priority interleave more
  frequently.

* Drop priveleges only after listening on possibly priveleged port

  Patch from moparisthebest

* Add --honor-cipher-order option to mitigate BEAST attacks

  Patch from moparisthebest

* Fix building on mac os x. "error: invalid suffix on literal; C++11
  requires a space between literal and identifier"

  Patch from snnn

* Allow server initiated stream ID in associated-stream-id

* spdycat, shrpx: TLS SNI enhancements

  shrpx:
  * Added an option to set the TLS SNI extension between shrpx and the
    origin on the command line

  spdycat:
  * If the user set an explicit host header ( using --headers ) use that
    name for the TLS SNI extension.
  * Added the handshake completion time to the verbose output
  * The gettimeofday call in get_time was using the incorrect structure
    ( I believe )
  * In update_html_parser it was submitting the request regardless of
    the return value of add_request.

  Patch from Stephen Ludin

* shrpx: Support non-TLS SPDY in frontend connection

* Don't allow control characters in outgoing name/value pairs

  This check is done in spdylay_submit_* family functions and they
  will return error if they found control characters.

* Don't pack multiple empty header values in one header field

  SPDY spec does not allow multiple empty header values in one header
  field. This change makes out-going framer ignore such empty header
  value if there is non-empty header value with the same name.

* Fix the incoming last empty header value is not checked properly

  This change fixes the bug that spdylay_frame_unpack_nv does not
  check the size of header value if it is the last value in NULL
  separated list.
