spdylay 0.2.1
=============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that closing a stream causes memory leak
and it also makes some other streams disappear.

The delta_window_size given in spdylay_submit_window_update() is now
not bounded by internal received data size.  The application is now
responsible to keep the resulting window size under the maximum value
described in the SPDY/3 specification.

The SPDY client spdycat gets new option -a and -s.  The -a option
makes spdycat download assets such as CSS and images linked from the
downloaded resource. The -s option shows statistics such as elapsed
time from the handshake.

Changes
-------

* Made spdylay_submit_window_update() not be bounded by
  recv_window_size.  Current SPDY/3 spec does not clearly prohibit to
  send delta_window_size which makes resulting window size more than
  initial window size. For this reason, spdylay_submit_window_update()
  can send delta_window_size in [1, (1 << 31)-1], inclusive, without
  bounded by stream's recv_window_size. Of course, the application is
  now responsible to keep the resulting window size <= (1 << 31)-1.

  spdylay_submit_window_update() now returns
  SPDYLAY_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT if delta_window_size is 0 or negative.

* Included README.rst in the manual.

* Added -s, --stat option to print statistics.  Print, for each
  stream, time delta from SSL/TLS handshake and each SYN_STREAM. The
  time deltas are measured after SYN_REPLY received and all data
  received.  For example, the following output:

      SYN_REPLY: X(Y)

  means SYN_REPLY was received X ms after SSL/TLS handshake and Y ms
  after the corresponding SYN_STREAM was sent.

* Added -a, --get-asserts option to spdycat. If this option is used,
  spdycat also downloads assets such as stylesheets, images and script
  files linked from the downloaded resource. They are queued in the
  same SPDY session.

* Fixed the bug that erase_rotate_recur() erases parent node.
